# 📘 Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) – C++ Programs

This repository contains **C++ implementations of Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** problems, organized **week-wise** as per academic coursework. Each week focuses on a specific set of algorithmic concepts, progressing from basic searching techniques to advanced divide-and-conquer and selection algorithms.

The goal of this repository is to provide:

* Clear and structured **week-wise practice**
* Easy **revision before exams**
* Readable and testable **C++ implementations**
